<p class="lead">Container Queries are one of the most anticipated new features in CSS. I recently got a chance to play with them a bit to take the new syntax for a spin.</p>

I came up with this demo of a book store. Each of the books is draggable and can be moved to one of three sections, with varying available space. Depending on where it is placed, different styles will be applied to the book. The [full source code](https://codepen.io/mxbck/pen/XWMrMOp) is up on Codepen. Here's how it looks:

<div class="extend">
    <video width="960" style="margin:0 auto; border: 1px solid var(--color-border);" preload controls>
        <source src="https://res.cloudinary.com/mxb/video/upload/v1621003114/bookstore_nnn2vr.webm" type="video/webm" />
        <source src="https://res.cloudinary.com/mxb/video/upload/v1621003115/bookstore_kkpxmt.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
    </video>
</div>

This demo currently only works in [Chrome Canary](https://www.google.com/chrome/canary/). Download the latest version, then enable Container Queries under *chrome://flags* to see them in action.

## Here's what's going on

Each of these books is a custom element, or "web component". They each contain a cover image, a title and an author. In markup they look like this:

```html
<book-element color="#ba423d">
    <img slot="cover" src="/books/1984.avif" alt="" />
    <span slot="title">1984</span>
    <span slot="author">George Orwell</span>
</book-element>
```

This then gets applied to a template which defines the internal Shadow DOM of the component. The `<slot>` elements in there will get replaced by the actual content we're passing in.

```html
<template id="book-template">
    <style></style>
    <article class="book">
        <div class="front">
            <slot name="cover"></slot>
        </div>
        <div class="meta">
            <h2 class="title"><slot name="title"></slot></h2>
            <p class="author"><slot name="author"></slot></p>
        </div>
    </article>
</template>
```

Alright, nothing too fancy yet, just some basic structure. 

The magic happens when we apply some internal styling to this. Everything inside that `<style>` tag will be scoped to the component - and since styles can not leak out of the shadow DOM and we can't (easily) style its contents from the outside, we have real component encapsulation.

Container Queries are one of the last few missing puzzle pieces in component-driven design. They enable us to give components __intrinsic__ styles, meaning they can adapt themselves to whatever sourroundings they are placed in.

The new key property there is `contain` - it lets us define an element as a container to compare container queries against. A value of `layout` indicates that nothing outside the element may affect its internal layout and vice versa. 

This allows the browser to optimize the number of calculations necessary to create the page layout. By adding `inline-size` to the rule, we tell the browser to respond to changes in width of the container.

```html
<template id="book-template">
    <style>
    /* Use Web Component as the Layout Container */
    :host {
        display: block;
        contain: layout inline-size;
    }
    </style>
    ...
</template>
```

In the bookstore demo, I created three variants that depend on the width of the component's `:host` (which translates to the `<book-element>` itself). I've omitted some of the styling for brevity here, but this part is where we define the multi-column or 3D book styles.

```css
/* Small Variant: Simple Cover + Title */
@container (max-width: 199px) {
    .book {
        padding: 0;
    }
}
/* Medium Variant: Multi-Column, with Author */
@container (min-width: 200px) and (max-width: 399px) {
    .book {
        display: grid;
        grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;
        gap: 1rem;
    }
}
/* Large Variant: 3D Perspective */
@container (min-width: 400px) {
    .book {
        position: relative;
        transform-style: preserve-3d;
        transform: rotateY(-25deg);
    }
}
```

## The Bento Box Idea

A general good idea in CSS is to separate "layout" from "content" components and let each handle their own specific areas of responsibility. I like to think of Japanese bento boxes as a metaphor for this: a container divided into specific sections that can be filled with anything.

For example, the layout for our bookstore looks like this:

<figure class="extend">
    <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/mxb/image/upload/v1621005967/grid_sa0gt0.png" style="border: 1px solid var(--color-border);" alt="">
</figure>

It's a grid divided into three sections, the middle one containing a nested flexible grid itself.

```html
<div class="layout">
    <div class="stage"></div>
    <main class="content">
        <ul class="itemlist"></ul>
    </main>
    <div class="cart"></div>
</div>
```

```scss
// main layout sections
.stage,
.content,
.cart {
    padding: var(--spacing);

    > * + * {
        margin-top: 1rem;
    }
}

// nested sub-grid
.itemlist {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(200px, 1fr));
    gap: var(--spacing);
}

// desktop layout
@media (min-width: 1024px) {
    .layout {
        display:grid;
        height: 100vh;
        grid-template-columns: 480px 1fr 130px;
    }
}
```

The parts of the layout are only concerned with the alignment and dimensions of boxes. They have no effect whatsoever on their children other than giving them a certain amount of space to fill. Just like a bento box, it doesn't care what we put into it, so we could easily re-use the layout for a completely different product - is is *content-agnostic*.

That's why container queries pair extremely well with CSS Grid. Grid defines a flexible layout from the outside, while container queries adapt whatever content sits inside it to the optimal size for the available space.
