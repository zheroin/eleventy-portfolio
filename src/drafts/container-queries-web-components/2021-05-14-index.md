<p class="lead">Container Queries are one of the most anticipated new features in CSS. I recently got a chance to play with them a bit to take the new syntax for a spin.</p>

The end result is this demo of a book store. Each of the books is draggable and can be moved to one of three sections, with varying available space. Depending on where it is placed, different styles will be applied to the book, e.g. to create a 3D-Effect or a multi-column layout. The [full source code](https://codepen.io/mxbck/pen/XWMrMOp) is up on Codepen.

This demo currently only works in [Chrome Canary](https://www.google.com/chrome/canary/). Download the latest version, then enable Container Queries under *chrome://flags* to see them in action.

## Here's what's going on

Each of these books is a custom element, or "web component". They just contain a cover image, title and author. In markup they look like this:

```html
<book-element color="#BA423D">
    <img slot="cover" src="/books/1984.avif" alt="" />
    <span slot="title">1984</span>
    <span slot="author">George Orwell</span>
</book-element>
```

This then gets transformed by a template which defines the internal Shadow DOM of the component. The `<slot>` elements in there will get replaced by the actual content we're passing into the component.

```html
<template id="book-template">
    <style></style>
    <article class="book">
        <div class="front">
            <slot name="cover"></slot>
        </div>
        <div class="meta">
            <h2 class="title"><slot name="title"></slot></h2>
            <p class="author"><slot name="author"></slot></p>
        </div>
    </article>
</template>
```

Alright, nothing too fancy yet, just some basic structure. 

The magic happens when we apply some internal styling though. Everything inside that `<style>` tag will be scoped to the component. Since styles can not leak out of the shadow DOM and we can't (easily) style its contents from the outside, we have a real encapsulation.

Container Queries are one of the last few missing puzzle pieces there. They enable us to give the component __intrinsic__ styles, meaning it can adapt itself to whatever sourroundings it is placed in. In the demo above, I've created three variants that depend on the width of the component's `:host` (which translates to the `<book-element>` itself).

The new property is `contain` - it lets us define an element as a layout container to compare container queries against.

```html
<template id="book-template">
    <style>
    /* Layout Container */
    :host {
        display: block;
        contain: layout inline-size;
    }
    /* Small Variant */
    @container (max-width: 200px) {
        .book {
            padding: 0;
        }
    }
    /* Medium Variant */
    @container (min-width: 201px) and (max-width: 399px) {
        .book {
            display: grid;
            grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;
            gap: 1rem;
        }
    }
    /* Large Variant */
    @container (min-width: 400px) {
        .book {
            position: relative;
            transform-style: preserve-3d;
            transform: rotateY(-25deg);
        }
    }
    </style>
    <article class="book">
        <div class="front">
            <slot name="cover"></slot>
        </div>
        <div class="meta">
            <h2 class="title"><slot name="title"></slot></h2>
            <p class="author"><slot name="author"></slot></p>
        </div>
    </article>
</template>
```

## The Bento Box Idea

A general good practice in CSS is to separate "layout" components from "content" components and let each handle their own specific areas of responsibility.

The layout for our bookstore looks like this:

<figure class="extend">
    <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/mxb/image/upload/v1621005967/grid_sa0gt0.png" style="border: 1px solid var(--color-border);" alt="">
</figure>

That's why container queries pair very well with CSS grid. Grid defines a flexible layout from the outside, while container queries adapt whatever content sits inside the grid to the optimal size for the available space.
