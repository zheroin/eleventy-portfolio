title: Media Queries in Times of @container

<p class="lead">With container queries now on the horizon - will we need media queries at all? Is there a future where we build responsive interfaces completely without them?</p>

Ethan, who coined the term [responsive web design](https://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design/) over a decade ago, has recently said that media-query-less layouts are certainly within bounds:

<blockquote>
<p>Can we consider a flexible layout to be “responsive” if it <strong>doesn’t</strong> use any media queries, but <strong>only</strong> uses container queries? [...] I’d be inclined to answer: yes, absolutely.</p>

</blockquote>

Over at CSS-Tricks, Chris had similar thoughts. He issued a challenge to examine how and where media queries are used today, and if they will still be necessary going forward:

<blockquote>
<p>A common refrain, from me included, has been that if we had container queries we’d use them for the vast majority of what we use media queries for today. The challenge is: look through your CSS codebase now with fresh eyes knowing how the @container queries currently work. Does that refrain hold up?</p>

Fair enough. 
I took the bait and had a look at some of my projects - and yes, most of what I use `@media` for today can probably be accomplished by `@container` at some point. Nevertheless, I came up with a few scenarios where I think media queries will still be necessary.

## For global tokens

```scss
:root {
    // Font Sizes
    --font-size-headline-l: 1.875rem; //30px
    --font-size-headline-m: 1.75rem; //28px
    --font-size-headline-s: 1.5rem; //24px
    --font-size-copy-l: 1.125rem; //18px
    --font-size-copy-s: 0.875rem; //14px

    // Global Spacing
    --spacing-x: 1rem;
    --spacing-y: 1rem;

    @media (min-width: 48em) {
        --font-size-headline-l: 2.5rem; //40px
        --font-size-headline-m: 2rem; //32px
        --font-size-headline-s: 1.75rem; //28px
        --font-size-copy-l: 1.25rem; //20px
        --font-size-copy-s: 1rem; //16px

        --spacing-x: 2rem;
        --spacing-y: 2rem;
    }
}

```

## For fixed-to-window stuff

Have a look at Twitter's "Messages" tab at the bottom of the screen - this is something that's fixed to the viewport. Its relevant container *is* the window, so it makes sense to use a media query here and only apply `position: fixed` at some breakpoint.

## For heights

The current implementation of `@container` only allows querying the width of an element, not its height. Changes in relation to width are the primary use case for most UI elements, but there are still cases where height is an issue.
