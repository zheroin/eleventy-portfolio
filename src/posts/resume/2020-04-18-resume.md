<p class="lead">Last week I came across <a href="https://ericwbailey.design/writing/how-to-not-make-a-resume-in-react.html">this post</a> by Eric Bailey. In it he describes some of the issues he's seeing with overengineered, inaccessible résumés.</p>

This again addresses the over-reliance on powerful Javascript frameworks like React, even in cases where simple semantic HTML might be better suited for the task.

I'm currently putting my self-isolated weekend time towards side projects, and I thought this could be something I can tackle. So I built something new:

## A résumé template

<figure class="extend">
    <a href="https://demo-resume.netlify.app"><img src="{{ 'resume.png' | media(page) }}" alt=""></a>
    <figcaption>A generated résumé on screen and in print</figcaption>
</figure>

This is a static micro-site generated by [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev) that can be used as an online résumé. The output is basically just a simple `index.html` file.

__Features:__

* Fully Customizable
* Semantic HTML
* Accessible (WCAG AA) 
* Print Styles
* [h-resume](http://microformats.org/wiki/h-resume) Microformat
* Integrated Spellcheck Linter
* Self-Contained (no external resources)
* Search Engine Optimized (meta, JSON-LD)
* Critical CSS Inlined

Many people are out of work due to the pandemic already, and even more might still lose their jobs as the world is headed towards a massive economic fallout. There is little we can do to stop that, but a tool like this might hopefully be a small help for people to find new work once the situation improves.
