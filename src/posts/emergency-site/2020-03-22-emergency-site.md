In cases of emergency, many organizations need a quick way to publish critical information. But existing (CMS) websites are often unable to handle sudden spikes in traffic.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Just received a shelter-in-place emergency alert with a web address for more information. Clicked the link. The site is down. All emergency sites should be static.</p>&mdash; Nicholas C. Zakas (@slicknet) <a href="https://twitter.com/slicknet/status/1239972949819404291?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 17, 2020</a></blockquote>

To make things worse, natural disasters can also damage local network infrastructure, sometimes leaving people with very poor mobile connections.

I've [written about](/blog/hurricane-web/) the practice of publishing minimal "text-only" versions of critical news websites before and I think it makes a lot of sense to rely on the [rule of least power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_least_power) for these things. When it comes to resilience, you just can't beat static HTML.

## An Emergency Website Kit

Like so many others, I'm currently in voluntary quarantine at home - and I used some time this weekend to put a small [boilerplate](https://github.com/maxboeck/emergency-site) together for this exact usecase.

Here's the main idea:  

* generate a static site with [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev)
* minimal markup, inlined CSS
* aim to transmit everything in the first connection roundtrip (~14KB)
* progressively enable offline-support w/ Service Worker
* set up [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/) for easy content editing
* one-click deployment via Netlify

The site contains only the bare minimum - no webfonts, no tracking, no unnecessary images. The entire thing should fit in a single HTTP request. It's basically just a small, ultra-lean blog focused on maximum resilience and accessibility. The Service Worker takes it a step further from there so if you've visited the site once, the information is still accessible even if you lose network coverage.

The end result is just a set of static files that can be easily hosted on cloud infrastructure and put on a CDN. Netlify does this out of the box, but other providers or privately owned servers are possible as well.

You can find the [project source on Github](https://github.com/maxboeck/emergency-site) as well as a [demo site here](https://emergency-site.dev/).

## Not Everyone is a Developer

I'm aware that not everyone, especially the people in charge of setting up websites like this, is familiar with things like Node or Github. I want to keep the barrier to getting a site like this off the ground as low as possible, so I'm currently working on two ideas:

### 1. No-Code Setup

Taking a hint from the excellent [servicerelief.us](https://www.servicerelief.us/start) project, it is possible to configure the template in such a way that all configuration can be done via environ variables.

These are set when the site is first deployed, meaning a user would only need a free Github and Netlify account to get started, without ever touching a line of code or having to mess around with npm or Eleventy itself. The content editing can all be done through Netlify CMS, which offers a much more useable graphical interface.

### 2. Volunteer Devs

Another great idea came from [Stephanie Walter]() on Twitter:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">True, but at some point there will always be single points of failures. I still like the idea of providing something simple to organizations, I just wonder how technical most people in those are. I wonder if there&#39;s some places to put in touch organizations with devs to help</p>&mdash; Stï¿½phanie W. (@WalterStephanie) <a href="https://twitter.com/WalterStephanie/status/1243516998790889473?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 27, 2020</a></blockquote>

Since even dealing with the unfamiliar landscapes of Github and Netlify might be a big ask for many non-technical organizations, it might be worth considering the help of volunteer developers.

The initial setup is a 10-minute job for devs who understand the stack. Organizations could get in touch with a volunteer to help them get the site online, then take over and update the content.
