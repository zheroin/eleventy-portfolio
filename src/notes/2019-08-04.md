The cat's out of the bag: we are organizing a [conference](https://webclerks.at) in November in Vienna! I've been working with [Tuzo](https://www.matuzo.at) and [Daniel](https://twitter.com/lctdnl) these past few weeks to get the website set up and this thing off the ground. I'm very excited about this and although there's still lots of work ahead of us, the lineup is already amazing.

Speakers include Rachel Andrew, Jeremy Keith, Heydon Pickering and more awesome people who are yet to be announced. We also have an [open CFP](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdMlydittpPpWLcd0tiDqadmAoaQv2nD8F8w4esqwdyKQt1aw/viewform) for the last slot - Take a look!
