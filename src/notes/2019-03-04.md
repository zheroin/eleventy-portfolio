Usually, when writing print CSS, you would want to omit `background-color` declarations to improve readability (and save ink).

I had a case at work today where I actually needed them to print. It was used in some progress indicators that didn't make any sense without it. Turns out soem browsers ignore `background-color` by default in print though, unless the user selects otherwise.

If you __absolutely have to__ override that, there's `-webkit-print-color-adjust: exact`.
It only works in Chrome and Safari though.

[-webkit-print-color-adjust on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/CSS/-webkit-print-color-adjust)
