I'm giving this _"weeknotes"_ thing a shot after seeing it on some other blogs! (I'm starting with 22 because that's the current calendar week).

* Started digging into webcomponents with lit-html. So far I like it, feels very straightforward.
* Met [Manuel](https://www.matuzo.at) for drinks and shoptalk. Interesting stuff is happening!
* Saw Ethan's Talk ["The World-Wide Work"](https://newadventuresconf.com/2019/coverage/ethan/) from New Adventures Conf, which really got me thinking about the general direction the web is taking, and our role as developers in it.
* Booked a flight for a spontaneous short trip to [Tbilisi](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Tiflis,+Georgien/@41.7392683,42.5970525,7z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x40440cd7e64f626b:0x61d084ede2576ea3!8m2!3d41.7151377!4d44.827096), Georgia.
